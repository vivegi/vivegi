- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivegi (Giri).
- 👀 I’m interested in curating Tamil classical literary works and making them accessible and available for the younger generation in digital and multimedia formats
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to collaborate on a global scale with volunteers on a massive passion project! Our first chosen work is the Tirukkuṟaḷ (திருக்குறள்). See: https://github.com/vivegi/thirukkural
- 💞️ I’m am seeking volunteer collaborators who are interested in Tamil and classical literary works and making them accessible to the world. We need Illustrators, Content editors, Translators (Tamil to all languages), Designers and more.
- 🎮 I wrote a web based game called Trek that is inspired by the Boolean CNF Satisfiability problem. See: https://github.com/vivegi/Trek repository and https://vivegi.github.io/Trek/ for the playable game.
